# Tech Stack

My portfolio is built using a combination of technologies to create an interactive and visually appealing experience. Here's the tech stack:

- **HTML:** The foundation of the website's structure and content.
- **CSS:** Styling is done using CSS to ensure a polished and visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript:** Adding interactivity and dynamic elements to enhance the user experience.

# Note -> 
You can change the theme of the website by clicking on the Magic button on the right corner and return back to the previous theme by clicking on it again


## Responsive Design

While the site is not fully responsive yet, So please explore it on pc with  100% size for best experience , efforts are underway to make it adapt seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Your insights are valuable as I continue to enhance and improve the portfolio.
